# SortedMultiMap
ADT SortedMultiMap â€“ using a DLLA with (key, value) pairs ordered based on a relation on the keys. A key can appear in multiple pairs.

C++ representation of Sorted MultiMap as an abstract data type - using DOUBLY LINKED LIST on array
This repository offers a representation of a Sorted MultiMap, having implemented multiple header and cpp files, together with some tests.

The SMMIterator.h and its cpp offer the header and the representation of an iterator which let us run through the multimap and perform multiple operations.
The SortedMultiMap.h and its cpp offer the header and the representation of the multimap itself, with all the private arguments and operation functions.

TO RUN THE PROJECT, create a project in a C++ IDE, I recommend Visual Studio Community or C Lion. Copy all the headers (.h) and cpp (.cpp) files and run the App.cpp. All the test should run correctly.
You can also see the complexities in the implementation of the functions and some explanations regarding the implementation.
